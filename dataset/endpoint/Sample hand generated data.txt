Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? <ECON> You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . <ECON> What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . <ECON> Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? <ECON> I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . <ECON> I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . <ECON> That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . <ECON> Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . <ECON> Good.Let ' s go now . <ECON> All right . <ECON>
Can you do push-ups ? <ECON> Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . <ECON> Really ? I think that's impossible ! <ECON> You mean 30 push-ups ? <ECON> Yeah ! <ECON> It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . <ECON>
Can you study with the radio on ? <ECON> No , I listen to background music . <ECON> What is the difference ? <ECON> The radio has too many comerials . <ECON> That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . <ECON>

It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . <ECON> Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? <ECON> A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! <ECON>

Hi , Becky , what's up ? <ECON> Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . <ECON> What's the problem ? <ECON> She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . <ECON> For example ? <ECON> Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . <ECON> No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . <ECON> It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . <ECON> My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . <ECON> You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? <ECON> We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . <ECON> That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . <ECON>

Do you like cooking ? <ECON> Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . <ECON> Why do you like it ? <ECON> I have no idea . I like cooking by myself .

I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . <ECON> Certainly . <ECON>

Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? <ECON> I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning <ECON> Does that mean studying all the time ? <ECON> I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . <ECON> Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . <ECON> You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts <ECON> Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . <ECON> Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . <ECON> You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . <ECON> Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . <ECON> Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . <ECON>
